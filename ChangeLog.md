**RELEASE Ver. 1.02**

* Fixed a spacing issue where a certain line can overlap the end.


**RELEASE Ver. 1.01**

***Bug Fixes***

* The button should now properly hide when closing the windows.

* Fixed an issue where if the players names were moved around they would still be updated at their old positions for the colored interact distance icon.

* Potentially resolves the issue where some larger names were bleeding over the edge of the mouseover. I will need confirmation on this one but I found a place where the width of the text could in some cases be as much as font 10 wifth wider than the frame.


***Quality of Life***

* No more of this bouncing around on where it is pinned. To increase functionality the button is now completely movable and you can customize where you want to set it. I have made this a per-character location as I know some people run different addons depending on the alt. Just hold CTRL-SHIFT to drag it.

* The player's own name will be included in the list now. This is due to the somewhat confusing aspect of saying group size is say 20, but only showing 19. To prevent any confusion.

* Compatibility with various UI addons for the interact distance notifier. The following are the addons with built-in compatibility now:

- ElvUI

- TUKUI

- Spartan UI

- Shadowed Unit Frames

- Z-Perl

- Grid

- Luna Unit Frames (Classic)
